# RCBinator: IPL Playoff Predictor üèè

RCBinator is an interactive web application that calculates the playoff chances for teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The app uses advanced Monte Carlo simulations to predict qualification probabilities based on current standings, remaining matches, and team performance metrics.

### üî¥ [Live App: RCBinator on Streamlit](https://rcbinator.streamlit.app/)


## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Team-Specific Experiences** - Custom UI themes and messaging based on team selection
- **Advanced Predictions** - Weighted simulation model using points (60%), NRR (10%), and team form (30%)
- **Multiple Visualizations** - Interactive charts, qualification paths, and prediction tables
- **Real-time Calculations** - Live data scraping from Cricbuzz for up-to-date predictions
- **Championship Probability** - Calculate not just playoff qualification but winning chances
- **Detailed Explanations** - Clear insights about prediction methodology and match outcomes

## üìä Prediction Methodology

RCBinator uses a sophisticated model to predict match outcomes:

1. **Team Strength Calculation**
   - Points Table Position (60% weight)
   - Net Run Rate (10% weight)
   - Recent Team Form (30% weight)
   - Historical head-to-head records

2. **Dynamic NRR Modeling**
   - Different NRR changes (0.03-0.12) based on match context
   - Factors in point difference between competing teams
   - Random variation for realistic outcomes

3. **Monte Carlo Simulations**
   - Runs millions of simulations (configurable from 50k to 2M)
   - More simulations = better accuracy (but longer calculation time)

## üíª Usage Guide

1. **Select Your Team**: Choose your favorite IPL team
2. **Set Simulation Count**: Higher counts give more accurate results
3. **View Results**: Check playoff chances, top 2 probabilities, and championship odds
4. **Explore Visualizations**: See points comparisons, paths to qualification, and more
